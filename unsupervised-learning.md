# Unsupervised Learning

**Unsupervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model learns patterns from unlabeled data without explicit supervision. Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the underlying structure or distribution in the data.

- **Clustering** is a technique used to group similar data points together based on their features. The goal of clustering is to partition the data into distinct groups, or clusters, such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Common clustering algorithms include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).

- **Dimensionality Reduction** is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much of the relevant information as possible. High-dimensional data can be difficult to visualize and analyze, and dimensionality reduction techniques help overcome this challenge. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and autoencoders are popular dimensionality reduction methods.

- **Association Rules** mining is a technique used to discover interesting relationships or patterns in large datasets. It aims to identify rules that describe the associations between different items in the data. Association rule mining is commonly used in market basket analysis, where the goal is to find relationships between products frequently purchased together. The Apriori algorithm is a well-known method for association rule mining.

- **Contrastive Learning** is a type of self-supervised learning where the model learns to differentiate between similar and dissimilar pairs of data points. In contrastive learning, the model is trained to pull together positive pairs (similar examples) while pushing apart negative pairs (dissimilar examples) in an embedding space. Contrastive learning has been shown to be effective for tasks such as representation learning, where the goal is to learn meaningful representations of data without explicit supervision.

Unsupervised Learning techniques play a crucial role in exploring and understanding the structure of data without labeled annotations. They are widely used in various domains, including clustering similar documents, reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data, discovering frequent patterns in transactional data, and learning representations of data for downstream tasks.
