# What is *Artificial Intelligence* (**AI**)?

*Artificial Intelligence* (**AI**) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more. **AI** systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, recognizing patterns, understanding language, and sensory perception.

**AI** can be classified into two main types: *narrow AI* and **general AI**. *Narrow AI*, also known as weak **AI**, is designed and trained for a specific task, such as language translation or image recognition. **General AI**, also referred to as strong **AI** or artificial general intelligence (*AGI*), would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.

**AI** has applications across various industries and sectors, including healthcare, finance, automotive, manufacturing, entertainment, and more. It's continuously evolving and has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society, leading to advancements in efficiency, productivity, and innovation.
