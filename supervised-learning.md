### 1.1.1 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input data is paired with corresponding target labels. The model learns to map input features to the correct output based on this labeled data.

- **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) by fitting a straight line to the data.

- **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the target variable has two possible outcomes. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class using a logistic function.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVM is a versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. SVM can handle linear and nonlinear decision boundaries through the use of different kernel functions.

- **Decision Trees**: Decision trees are tree-like structures used for classification and regression tasks. They split the feature space into regions based on feature values, making decisions by following a path from the root to a leaf node, where the prediction is made.

- **Random Forests**: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data and features, and predictions are made by averaging the predictions of individual trees.

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: ANNs are a class of algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers, with each node applying a transformation to its inputs. ANNs can be used for both classification and regression tasks and are capable of learning complex patterns from data.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: CNNs are a type of neural network particularly well-suited for processing grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input data, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification and object detection.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: RNNs are a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data, where the order of inputs matters. They have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to maintain a memory of past inputs. RNNs are commonly used for tasks such as sequence prediction, language modeling, and time series analysis.
