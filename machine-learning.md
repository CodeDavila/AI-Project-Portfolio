# What is *Machine Learning*?

**Machine learning** is a subset of **artificial intelligence** (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming instructions. Instead of being explicitly programmed to carry out a specific task, machine learning algorithms use patterns and inference to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

The process of **machine learning** involves feeding large amounts of data into algorithms, which then iteratively learn from that data to improve their performance. This learning process often involves the identification of patterns, relationships, and trends within the data, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.

There are several types of **machine learning** approaches, including:

1. **Supervised Learning**: In **supervised learning**, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning that the input data is paired with the correct output. The algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions by generalizing from the labeled examples it has been given.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: **Unsupervised learning** involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, where the algorithm must find patterns or structure in the data on its own. This can include tasks such as clustering similar data points together or dimensionality reduction.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: **Reinforcement learning** is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions.

4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: **Semi-supervised learning** combines elements of supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves training algorithms on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data, which can be useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

5. **Transfer Learning**: **Transfer learning** is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused or adapted as the starting point for a model on a second task. It leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem and applies it to a related problem, often leading to improvements in learning efficiency and performance.

**Machine learning** has a wide range of applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, robotics, and more. It is used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics, among others.
